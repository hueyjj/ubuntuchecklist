Software, configuration, scripts, and dotfiles checklist for new ubuntu install

Commands won't be provided, because they change over time. PPA's, curling into bash, etc.,
might not yield the same result one or two years from now. Also, better tools may have come
out by then.

- Vim
- Use PPA, not default in ubuntu repo (they didn't compile with more features and it's earlier version of vim)
  Default also doesn't compie with clipboard feature.
- Visual studio code
- Postman
- Pgadmin
- Curl
- Discord
- Postgresql
- NPM (current known method for latest version is a command curling into bash execution (oof, yikes))
- Nodejs
